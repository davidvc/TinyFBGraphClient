Please find here provided a very simple Java client for accessing
the new Facebook "Open" Graph API.  Take a look at the samples
in testsrc to see how it works, but it's pretty simple.

I have included all the third-party jar files you need to run
(except junit.jar). 

I have also included the Eclipse project used to build it, so
if you're an Eclipse user that should make your life easier.
